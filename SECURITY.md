## 🔒 Secure Code Contributions

Please refrain from depending on any external source - for instance, noVNC-latest is bundled into the Module.

Best practices should be followed during Software Engineering which is especially hard when only patching.

### For instance, work to implement:

- Principle of Least Privilege
- Input Validation & Sanitisation
- Secure Communication (HTTPS etc)
- Compatibility with core/updates
- Thorough inline comments/specs
- Robust error handling/logging
- Secure configs by default

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

GitHub "Private vulnerability reporting" is enabled for the MasterMindTIBR/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS repository (the MasterMind TI fork): https://github.com/MasterMindTIBR/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS/security/advisories/new

If the issue also exists in the upstream module, report it to The Network Crew Pty Ltd as well, through private vulnerability reporting on The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS.

DO NOT raise a public issue where there is threat to users of the module. Raise it properly.

### No bounties offered

This project does not pay security bounties; the focus is on writing good code.

We appreciate your input and work to address issues as quickly as possible, security first and foremost.

Updates can be provided as promptly as days apart, however this depends on severity/scope, and is always reasonable.
